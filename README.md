# Leech
A simple OSX CLI tool that changes your MAC address to a new random address.

## Usage
As it changes ifconfig settings, you need to run the script with sudo:
```
sudo python Leech.py
```

On first start, it saves your current MAC address to disk and you can reset to it anytime:
```
sudo python Leech.py --reset
```
